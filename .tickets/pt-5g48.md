# Add topic browser + open docs via $PAGER/$EDITOR

## Task
Add a topics browser view and ability to open a selected topic doc (plan/backlog/overview) via `$PAGER` or `$EDITOR`.

## Context
MVP avoids inline markdown rendering. Opening docs externally is sufficient and keeps scope small.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] UI lists topics by type and supports simple filtering
- [ ] User can open a doc for a selected topic (uses `$PAGER` if set, else falls back to `less` or `$EDITOR`)
- [ ] Missing docs are handled gracefully (message)

## Constraints
- Do not render markdown inline for MVP

## References
- Plan: plan-ticketflow-kanban-tui

- Added key bindings (o, 1-4) to open topic documents
