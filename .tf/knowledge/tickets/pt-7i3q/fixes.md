## Fix Log
No fixes applied. The implementation was complete and correct on first submission.

## Minor Issues (not fixed - low priority)
1. Partial string assertions in `test_ticket_title_with_special_characters` - acceptable for current test coverage
2. Could add additional verification for key-based vs value-based redaction distinction

## Notes
All 47 tests pass, including 9 new tests for ticket_title functionality. The implementation meets all acceptance criteria.
