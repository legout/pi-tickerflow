# Research: pt-5g48

## Status
Research enabled. No additional external research was performed.

## Rationale
- The ticket involves adding TUI functionality to an existing Textual-based UI
- The existing codebase already had the `open_topic_doc()` helper function defined
- Implementation followed existing patterns from the `TopicBrowser` class
- The Textual library's documentation patterns for key bindings and actions are well-understood

## Context Reviewed
- `tk show pt-5g48` - Ticket requirements
- `tf_cli/ui.py` - Existing TUI implementation
- `tests/test_topic_loader.py` - Existing test patterns
- Textual library patterns for reactive widgets and actions

## Sources
- (none - internal codebase knowledge sufficient)
