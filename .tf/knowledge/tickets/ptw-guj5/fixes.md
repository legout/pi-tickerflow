## Review Analysis
- Critical: 0
- Major: 0
- Minor: 1 (edge case warning improvement)
- Warnings: 1 (test coverage)
- Suggestions: 2 (error handling improvements)

## Decision
The single Minor issue relates to adding clearer warnings when Python is unavailable for TOML parsing. This is an edge case enhancement, not a required fix. The implementation is functionally complete and working correctly.

No code changes were made.
