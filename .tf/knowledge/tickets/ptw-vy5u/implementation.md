# Implementation: ptw-vy5u

## Summary
Documented versioning scheme and human release process in VERSIONING.md and README.md.

## Files Changed
- `VERSIONING.md` - Rewrote with clear SemVer policy, decision matrix, and step-by-step release checklist
- `README.md` - Added "Versioning and Releases" section with quick reference and link to full docs

## Key Decisions
