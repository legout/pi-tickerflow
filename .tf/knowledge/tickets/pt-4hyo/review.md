## Suggestions (follow-up ticket)
- `docs/tf-followups-scan-manual-test.md` - Consider adding a link back to `docs/commands.md` for readers who discover the test doc first.
- `docs/tf-followups-scan-manual-test.md` - Consider using `bash` syntax highlighting consistently (some code blocks lack language specifier).
- `docs/tf-followups-scan-manual-test.md` - Consider adding a note about test cleanup (test cases create directories that should be removed after testing).
