# Review (Second Opinion): pt-cje7

## Overall Assessment
This is a clean documentation-only change that clarifies the execution model differences between MCP servers. The note is well-placed for visibility and accurately distinguishes local npx-based execution (`zai-vision`) from remote URL-based services (`zai-web-search`, `zai-web-reader`).

## Critical (must fix)
No issues found.

## Major (should fix)

## Minor (nice to fix)

## Warnings (follow-up ticket)

## Suggestions (follow-up ticket)

## Positive Notes
- The blockquote note format effectively distinguishes the clarification from regular table content without disrupting the table structure
- Changelog entry follows Keep a Changelog conventions with clear description of the documentation addition
- Accurate technical details: correctly identifies the npx package name (`@z_ai/mcp-server`) and Node.js/npx prerequisites
- Strategic placement after the MCP servers table ensures users see the clarification immediately after scanning available options
- Consistent with existing documentation style and formatting
