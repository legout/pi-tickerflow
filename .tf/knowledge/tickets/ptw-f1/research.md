# Research: ptw-f1

## Status
Research enabled. No additional external research was performed.

## Rationale
- This is a straightforward documentation improvement ticket
- The issue is clearly identified: the `--no-deps` flag is only mentioned in step 9 of the Backlog Generation procedure
- The fix requires adding documentation in the procedure introduction and/or early steps
- Context already available from reading the SKILL.md file

## Context Reviewed
- `tk show ptw-f1` - Ticket details
- `skills/tf-planning/SKILL.md` - Full skill documentation
- Located Backlog Generation procedure and identified where `--no-deps` is currently mentioned

## Sources
- skills/tf-planning/SKILL.md (lines around step 9 for dependency inference)
