# MVP Scope

## In Scope

- Confirm/establish a runnable entry point that works with `textual serve`.
- Add documentation (README/docs) showing how to run in web mode.
- Add minimal configuration for host/port/bind.

## Out of Scope (for MVP)

- Multi-user / shared sessions.
- Authentication/authorization beyond a warning / best-practice guidance.
- Production deployment guides (reverse proxy, TLS, containers) beyond brief pointers.
- Cross-browser compatibility hardening beyond a smoke test.
