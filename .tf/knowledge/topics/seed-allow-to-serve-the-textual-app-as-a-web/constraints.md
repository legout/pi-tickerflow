# Constraints

- Must not break the existing terminal (non-web) execution path.
- Keep defaults safe: avoid binding publicly unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer minimal additional dependencies and minimal new runtime configuration.
- Documentation should be accurate for supported platforms (Linux/macOS/Windows where applicable).
