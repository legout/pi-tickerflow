# Success Metrics

- Users can start the app with `textual serve` and successfully load the UI in a browser.
- The web-served UI is usable for core flows (no major rendering/input regressions vs terminal).
- Clear docs exist with copy/paste commands and expected output/URLs.
- Basic configuration (host/port) is supported and works reliably.
