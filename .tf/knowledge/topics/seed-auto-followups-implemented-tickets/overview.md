# seed-auto-followups-implemented-tickets

Add a command that scans implemented tickets in `.tf/knowledge/tickets/` and automatically runs `/tf-followups` for any ticket directory missing a `followups.md` artifact.

This keeps the knowledge base consistent and reduces the chance that review warnings/suggestions never get converted into actionable follow-up tickets.
