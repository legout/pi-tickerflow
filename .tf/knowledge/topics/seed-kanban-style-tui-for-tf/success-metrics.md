# Success Metrics

- Users can see an at-a-glance board of ready/blocked/in-progress tickets.
- Users can search for a ticket by keyword and open it in <2 seconds.
- Users can browse plan/seed/spike topics without memorizing paths.
- UI works in common terminals (macOS/Linux) and degrades gracefully in non-TTY.
