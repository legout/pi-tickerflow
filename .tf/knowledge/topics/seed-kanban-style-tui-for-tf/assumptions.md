# Assumptions

- Ticketflow tickets live in `.tickets/` and can be parsed as markdown with YAML frontmatter.
- Knowledge base is available at `.tf/knowledge/` and index.json is up to date.
- Users prefer keyboard-first navigation (mouse optional).
- A Textual-based UI is acceptable as a dependency for this repo.
