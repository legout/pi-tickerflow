# Constraints

- Keep the UX simple; avoid replacing one required knob with another.
- Prefer minimal behavioral change beyond removing the forwarded `--session` parameter.
- Must not break existing workflows that rely on resuming runs.
- Any migration should be backwards compatible or clearly communicated.
