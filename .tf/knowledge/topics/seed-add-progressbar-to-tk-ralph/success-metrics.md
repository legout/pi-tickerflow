# Success Metrics

- Running `tk ralph` in a terminal shows clear, stable progress without log spam.
- Progress display does not break when errors occur (errors still visible).
- In non-interactive mode (no TTY), output remains readable (no animated control characters).
- Debuggability is preserved: detailed logs/tool output can still be captured to a file when suppressed on screen.
