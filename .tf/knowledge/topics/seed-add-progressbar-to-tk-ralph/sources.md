- User request: “add a progressbar to `tk ralph`. Use this optionally instead of the current logging. suppress pi output”

## Notes

- Candidate implementation likely touches the `tk ralph` runner/loop and logging output pathways.
- Consider reusing any existing progress/log infrastructure in the project before adding dependencies.
